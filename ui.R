The status of each country is calculated by taking tonnes of seafood produced, weighting it for sustainability and dividing it by the country's coastal population to scale it across the global. Since OHI also defines higher mariculture statuses as those that are maximizing sustainable harvest from the oceans, we compare the production per coastal population to the highest global historic production capacity.
